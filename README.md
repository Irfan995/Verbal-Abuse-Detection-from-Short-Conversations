## 📘 Overview

Smart assistants and smart microphones can contribute to detecting verbal abuse by analyzing speech-to-text contents. In this paper, we compare different **large language models (LLMs)** for detecting verbal abuse and propose a framework that first identifies emotion from short audio conversations by extracting **Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) and Mel Spectrogram (MEL)** features. It then utilizes **transfer learning** with a fully connected neural network incorporating an attention mechanism and **SBERT** encoding. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we prepared a custom dataset containing instances of verbal abuse. Evaluation results show that our framework is lightweight and achieves commendable accuracy compared to the existing LLM models.

The repository includes:
- **`multi_label_saf.py`** — core model training and evaluation  
- **`k_folded_context_detection_saf.py`** — K-Fold cross-validation framework for performance reliability  
- **`Emotions_All_Data.csv`** — dataset containing multi-emotion annotations  
- **`family_conflict_conv.xlsx`** — conversational transcripts for contextual understanding

- Sentence-level semantic embeddings using **SBERT/BERT**
- Attention mechanism for contextual fusion
- K-Fold validation to ensure generalization
- Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score
- End-to-end preprocessing and tokenization pipeline
- Easily extendable for new emotion taxonomies or datasets

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The **Smart Annotation Framework (SAF)** model integrates:
1. **Sentence Embeddings:** obtained from Sentence-BERT or a similar transformer encoder  
2. **Attention Layer:** captures contextual dependencies between utterances  
3. **Dense Layers:** project contextualized embeddings into the multi-label output space  

```python
# Simplified example
encoded = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2').encode(sentences)
contextual = AttentionLayer()(encoded)
output = Dense(num_labels, activation='sigmoid')(contextual)
```

## 🧩 Extending the Framework

To adapt the framework for a new dataset:
1. Place the dataset file (CSV/XLSX) in the project root.  
2. Update the `DATASET_PATH` variable in `multi_label_saf.py`.  
3. Modify `LABEL_COLUMNS` to match your new annotation scheme.  
4. Run the training script — the pipeline automatically preprocesses and trains.
